# Development Partnership

We're building production-quality code together. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.

When you seem stuck or are creating an overly complex solution, I'll provide guidance to help you stay on track.

## üö® AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
**ALL automated check issues are BLOCKING - EVERYTHING must be ‚úÖ GREEN!**
No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance.
These are not suggestions. Fix ALL issues before continuing.

When checks report ANY issues, you MUST:
1.  **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not continue with other tasks.
2.  **FIX ALL ISSUES** - Address every reported issue until everything passes.
3.  **VERIFY THE FIX** - Re-run the failed command to confirm it's fixed.
4.  **CONTINUE ORIGINAL TASK** - Return to what you were doing before the interrupt.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW: Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement
**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:
1.  **Research**: Explore the codebase and understand existing patterns.
2.  **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me.
3.  **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints.

When asked to implement any feature, you'll first say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions or challenging problems, engage maximum reasoning capacity. Say: "Let me think through this architecture before proposing a solution."

### Reality Checkpoints
**Stop and validate** your work at these moments:
- After implementing a complete feature.
- Before starting a new major component.
- When something feels wrong or overly complex.
- Before declaring a task "done".
- **WHEN AUTOMATED CHECKS FAIL WITH ERRORS** ‚ùå

Run all local verification steps, such as `make fmt && make test && make lint`, to ensure quality.

## Working Memory & Task Management

### When context gets long:
- Re-read this `AGENT.md` file.
- Summarize progress in a `PROGRESS.md` file.
- Document the current state before making major changes.

### Maintain `PLAN.md`:
A `PLAN.md` file helps track the current state of work.
```
## Current Task
- [ ] The task currently being worked on.

## Completed
- [x] Tasks that are done, tested, and verified.

## Next Steps
- [ ] What comes after the current task.
```

## General Implementation Standards

### Required Practices:
- **Delete Old Code**: When replacing logic, remove the old implementation.
- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., `userID` instead of `id`).
- **Early Returns**: Use guard clauses and early returns to reduce nesting.
- **Simple Errors**: Propagate errors with added context.
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table-driven tests for functions with complex logic or multiple cases.

### Definition of Done
Code is considered complete when:
- ‚úÖ All linters pass with zero issues.
- ‚úÖ All tests pass.
- ‚úÖ The feature works end-to-end.
- ‚úÖ Old code is deleted.
- ‚úÖ Public functions and types are documented.

### Testing Strategy
- **Complex business logic** ‚Üí Write tests first.
- **Simple CRUD operations** ‚Üí Write tests after implementation.
- **Performance-critical paths** ‚Üí Add benchmarks.

## Problem-Solving Together

When you're stuck or confused:
1.  **Stop**: Don't spiral into overly complex solutions.
2.  **Step back**: Re-read the requirements and project goals.
3.  **Simplify**: The simple, direct solution is usually the correct one.
4.  **Ask**: Propose different approaches. For example: "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

## Performance & Security

### Measure First:
- No premature optimization.
- Benchmark before and after making performance-related changes.
- Use profiling tools to find real bottlenecks.

### Security Always:
- Validate all external inputs.
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators.
- Use prepared statements for SQL queries to prevent injection attacks.

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Updates:
Use a clear, concise format to report progress.
```
‚úì Implemented authentication (all tests passing)
‚úì Added rate limiting
‚úó Found issue with token expiration - investigating
```

### Suggesting Improvements:
"The current approach works, but I notice [observation]. Would you like me to [specific improvement]?"
